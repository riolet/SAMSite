                <p>SAM is an interactive network-traffic mapping tool.</p>
                <p>It uses information from the connection logs of routers and draws a map of the connections between hosts.</p>
                <p>Using SAM, you can visualize your network as a graph of endpoints, connections, and ports, and see detailed information about the connections to and from each node.  SAM provides a visual representation of what nodes are connecting to what other nodes on your network, and enables a high-level view of the architecture.</p>
                <p>Designed with a system architect's needs in mind, SAM consolidates information about the health and connectivity of a network and makes it simple to comprehend.</p>
                <p>For more information about SAM, read the <a href="/about">about</a> page.  For a hands-on experience, try the <a href="/demo">demo</a>!</p>
